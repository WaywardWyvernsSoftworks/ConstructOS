# TalOS
![TalOSLinesLogoClean](https://github.com/WaywardWyvernsSoftworks/TalOS/assets/26259870/d43eb0d1-dcdd-4b4c-abf9-3ecda3b2d996)
TalOS is intended to be the one shop stop for all things LLM, and some things Stable Diffusion. You can create Constructs, which is a type character. You can import Constructs from Traditional Character cards, in both V1 and V2 format, but a lot of fields will be missing, and I'd highly reccomend taking the time to expore the edit UI for all imported cards. Thought patterns, sprites, greetings, farewells, relationships, and interests are all unique to TalOS and if you intended to do more than RP with your character, it will be highly beneficial to fully flesh out your construct.
## Development Build Setup
1. Download the Repo using ```git clone https://github.com/WaywardWyvernsSoftworks/TalOS.git```
2. Ensure you have needed dependencies, which luckily for this application only includes Node.JS which can be downloaded here (downloading the LTS build is reccommended): https://nodejs.org/en
3. Go inside of the root of the cloned repo, and run the 'dev-run.bat' or 'dev-run.sh'.
### You're done! The app will open up a window, and you can explore the rest from there.
